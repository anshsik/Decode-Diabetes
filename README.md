# Decode-Diabetes

A comprehensive data analytics dashboard built to uncover insights into diabetes trends across different demographic and lifestyle factors. This project leverages advanced data visualization techniques to analyze risk factors, age distribution, education levels, and gender-based differences related to diabetes.

## Overview
Decode-Diabetes is an interactive analytics report designed to make sense of complex diabetes datasets. It helps healthcare analysts, researchers, and policymakers identify patterns and correlations between factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, and income level.

By combining visual analytics with statistical aggregation, this project provides a holistic understanding of diabetes prevalence, risk distribution, and lifestyle influences.
